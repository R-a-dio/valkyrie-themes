                                <li>It wasn't from a Japanese anime, game, or other media production.</li>
                                <li>Nobody involved in the production of the song was from Japan.</li>
                                <li>It was TV size; we only accept full size releases.</li>
                                <li>It was low quality and/or a youtube/soundcloud/other bad source rip. Note that bitrate is not always indicative of quality. Anything below 192kbps is rejected either way.</li>
                                <li>It was already in the database. Sometimes songs are mistagged, and that's our fault. You should still search as thoroughly as possible to make sure what you're uploading isn't a duplicate</li>
                                <li>Someone had uploaded the same song, but it wasn't accepted yet, in which case the submission that's highest quality gets accepted and the others declined.</li>

                                <li>It had a bitrate below at least 256kbps.</li>
                                <li>It was a bad transcode (for example, from 192kbps mp3 to 320kbps mp3).</li>
                                <li>It's too niche (nobody wants to listen to it except you).</li>
                                <li>If tags are in Japanese: you didn't mention source, artist, song title, etc.</li>

                            <p>Yes, and those won't be removed. They were accepted when there were not really any rules for accepting submissions. We just won't accept stuff like that anymore.</p>

                            <p>Any high quality music that's /a/ or /jp/ related, including doujin music, remixes, mashups, video game music, jpop, etc. <u>Simply having Japanese influence doesn't make something /a/ or /jp/</u>, and any such submissions will be declined.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Remixes and mashups are exempt from the "nobody involved in production is from Japan" rule</b>, and are ok to upload, as long as the original song that was remixed or mashed up would have been accepted. There's a little more scrutiny with these, however; bad mashups or remixes might get declined even if otherwise acceptable.</p>
